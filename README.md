# Partial Domination in Graph Theory
This repository contains the files utilized in my thesis research on partial domination.
We attempted two approaches toward finding partial domination sets: permutations and subsets.
The subsets approach was more computationally efficient, so we proceeded to use that for the project.
Additionally, Excel files were created, and variables were stored throughout the process.
This allowed for visualzations to be done.

This repo contains:
1. PartialDomination.ipynb -> this is a Jupyter Notebook where computations were performed
2. PartialDomination_Permutations.ipynb -> this is a Jupyter Notebook with the original permutation function that is not being used
3. Visualization.ipynb -> this is a Jupyter Notebook that explores different visualizations and analysis from the collected data
4. partial_domination_results_14_vertices.xlsx -> this is an Excel file containing data calculated for trees up to 14 vertices
5. df.csv -> dataframe saved as a csv
6. trees_list.pkl -> trees_list as a pickle saved object
